A sample project using Clean architecture and MVP


## Motivation

Auto learning and make an example of Clean Architecture with MVP are the principal motivation for this app

Inspired by the project [EffectiveAndroidUI](https://github.com/pedrovgs/EffectiveAndroidUI) by @pedrovgs that I fully recommend


Clean architecture
------------

The Clean architecture search to make independent our code from data sources, UI, Frameworks, etc.

Make our code more testable

MVP
------------

Model view presenter is one of the most used architectural pattern in Android. This pattern can be used with few limitations as Activities and Fragments have more responsibility than a simple view. Anyways its a wonderful pattern to be used in Android applications.
